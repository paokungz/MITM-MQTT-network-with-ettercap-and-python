This project demonstrates a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack on MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) using Ettercap and Paho-MQTT.
MITM MQTT with Ettercap and Paho-MQTT
This project demonstrates a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack on MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) using Ettercap and Paho-MQTT. MQTT is a lightweight messaging protocol used commonly in IoT (Internet of Things) devices. However, without proper security measures, MQTT communications can be intercepted and altered.

Features
MQTT MITM Setup: Use Ettercap to establish a MITM attack and capture MQTT packets between a client and broker.
Packet Analysis: Inspect MQTT packets to understand the communication structure between the devices.
Message Interception: Intercept and modify MQTT messages in transit using Paho-MQTT library.
Demonstration Scripts: Python scripts using Paho-MQTT to subscribe, publish, and modify MQTT messages.
Requirements
Python: Version 3.x for running Paho-MQTT scripts.
Ettercap: Network security tool for MITM attacks.
Paho-MQTT: Python MQTT client library for interacting with MQTT broker.
Getting Started
Install Dependencies: Ensure you have Ettercap and Python installed. Install Paho-MQTT using pip:
bash
คัดลอกโค้ด
pip install paho-mqtt
Run Ettercap: Launch Ettercap to start the MITM attack on the network.
Run Scripts: Use the provided Python scripts to simulate MQTT communication and interception.
